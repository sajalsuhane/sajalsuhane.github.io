            The Beginning <br>

    <p style="color:black">
        I was born and brought up in Madhya Pradesh, India. I completed my higher studies in Indore, Madhya Pradesh at Choithram School North Campus with distinction in academics and many awards such as
        'Brain of M.P.', 'Best Idea Award' etc. Along with it, I also had an inclination towards table tennis from the very beginning. In my 10th standard, I was awarded as School Level State Champion for Table Tennis.
        Clearing 'Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains' held in India on merit basis, I got admission in Pune, Maharashtra at Dr. D.Y. Patil Institute of Technology, Pimpri which has one of the finest computer engineering program
        amongst all the other reputed colleges in India.

            Undergraduate Studies <br>
        </h2>

    <p style="color:black">
        In my first year of engineering, I started studying about computers and eventually the stream seemed more interesting when I read about how algorithms, databases, networks etc. actually worked.
        According to Pune University’s curriculum, we are taught basics of every engineering branch in first year, which teaches an individual to work in interdisciplinary projects.
        In my free time, I used to read books on Computer Networks and Artificial Intelligence which made up my mind to explore more on these topics.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p style="color:black">
        Moving to my second year, I was part of Rotaract Club in which we did community service events such as Orphanage Visit (Providing orphans with food, books, pens and clothes), cleaning the city waste, helping the traffic police etc. Along with the team, I also organized an International Quiz Competition and whatever profit we gained from that was donated to Cancer patients for their treatment.
        During the semester, I was introduced to term ‘Machine Learning’. The concept of Machine Learning fascinated me so much, that I did a certification on Machine Learning from Stanford University via Coursera taught by Prof. Andrew Ng. The course was so thorough that it did not only made me learn the concepts, but also implement it.
        I learnt and implemented Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, SVM, KNN and Recommender Systems. Along with studies and certifications, I also gained experience of working in a team. <br><br>
    </p>

    <p style="color:black">
        In the third year, I became part of Computer Society of India, and served as Vice President for the student chapter. Being Vice President of a committee with 75 members working with me seemed to be an excruciating task at first, but as the term proceeded gradually, I got to know the power of teamwork, maintaining relations and decision making.
        Along with organising many events related to technology such as Acunetix, State Level Project Competition etc., I also led to development of an android application for the ISKCON Temple. The project was a Temple Management Application, which is currently being used by the Pandits and devotees of that temple. We worked in a team of four, using Firebase as unstructured database on backend
        and integrated it with the help of Android Studio. Also, we made the application UI user friendly, so that the management of the temple can make changes on their own. The application was built on API level 16, so that every user from Android 4.1.1 to the latest versions can use it efficiently. Along with the project, I also presented a seminar on Object Detection using Convolutional Neural
        Networks (and its comparison with You Only Look Once), in which I researched extensively on the topic and was really appreciated by professors at the institute. I ended my tenure as well as my third year of engineering in May ’19 with being in top 10 rank holders.
        According to me, involvement in such type of activities along with academics, not only helps community, but also builds leadership skills in you. <br><br>

    <p style="color:black">
        In my final year, I took up some courses on Python and Data Science by LinkedIn Learning, in which I did not only brush up my ML skillset, but also learned many new things such as Data Wrangling, building various regression and classification models and prediction using them. I completed my final year project entitled ‘Real Time Predictive Analytics and Decision Making for Industrial Robots’ (as a part of curriculum) under the guidance of Principal Dr. Pramod D. Patil. This is the continuation of my project work in internship at Brabo Robotics and Automation Ltd.
        Along with it, I was elected as President of Computer Society of India which comes up with a new set of responsiblities such as management of executive committee, enhanhcing working of the organization etc.
