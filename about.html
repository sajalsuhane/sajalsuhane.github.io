            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                During my undergraduate studies, I pursued computer engineering and honed my skills in software development. Now, as a Master of Science graduate from UTD, I continue to excel in software engineering.

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>Analyst, Software Developer - CFOSS</h3>
            <p>
                At Goldman Sachs, I lead the design and development of a cloud-native architecture, crafting scalable, high-performance solutions aligned with organizational goals. I orchestrated on-premises workflow migration to AWS Cloud, achieving a remarkable 90% reduction in processing time from 20 minutes to under 2 minutes. My innovative problem-solving skills drive substantial time and cost savings, staying up-to-date with cloud tech trends.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Summer Analyst, Software Developer – Controllers Division</h3>
            <p>
                During my internship at Goldman Sachs, I worked on developing an in-house operational storage tool, handling billions of data every second. I created dashboards in Kibana, resulting in decreased ingestion time by 30%. Additionally, I contributed to a POC for a queuing system, estimated to increase efficiency by 31.7%.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Graduate Research Assistant, Analytics and Product Development</h3>
            <p>
                At the University of Texas at Dallas, I developed algorithms to collect, clean, and analyze data generated by biomedical sensors, reducing human FTE by 0.6. I also assisted in building databases to organize sensor data, worked on cross-platform applications, and increased operational efficiency by 70%.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Assistant Systems Engineer, Developer – Digitate</h3>
            <p>
                At Tata Consultancy Services, I enhanced ignio's capabilities, reducing overall MTTR by 7000 hours/month across 100+ clients. I completed Architecture & Security Reviews for UK/EU-based clients and successfully deployed ignio in their environments. I also developed AI-based algorithms for autonomous actions, saving 9000+ human hours/year worldwide.

            <h2>Undergraduate Experience</h2>
            <h3>Rotaract Club</h3>
            <p>
                As a member of the Rotaract Club during my undergraduate studies, I actively participated in community service events, including providing support to orphanages, city waste cleanup, and assisting traffic police. I organized an International Quiz Competition, and the profits were donated to cancer patients for their treatment.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Machine Learning Certification</h3>
            <p>
                My fascination with machine learning led me to complete a certification in Machine Learning from Stanford University via Coursera. The course, taught by Prof. Andrew Ng, covered a wide range of machine learning topics, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, SVM, KNN, and Recommender Systems. Alongside my studies, I gained valuable teamwork experience.
